Started my journey to my Master's Degree with **Ecole 2600**, **hoping it will be stepping stone** to my career.

For the moment, I am training to developp my skills on infoSec. Im active on differents training sites as [Root-me](https://www.root-me.org/Paiinxz) and [LetsDefend](https://app.letsdefend.io/user/paiinxz). Also on some **[CTF](#fa-solid-fa-list-check-past-ctf)**


In the future I am looking to be a **DFIR** inside a SOC or public service organization :). I love investigations, that's why I love **OSINT, Forensics and Steganography**. 
I also started my journey on a Reverse Engineering that i look forward to see what i'll learn and how strong i will become.
